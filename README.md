# Challenge Description

[eiendomspriser.no](http://eiendomspriser.no/) is a service that finds house prices in your area. We would like you to make a mini-version of this service. With the possibility of searching for a street address, get the five last sold apartments nearby. Preferably use vanilla javascript + HTML + CSS.

Fancy backend or frameworks are not needed. Services like Kartverket and SSB or similar services could give you access to the numbers you need to accomplish the task. The key to solving this task is to get access to API's.

Please also make sure that the web-app runs on Github pages.
